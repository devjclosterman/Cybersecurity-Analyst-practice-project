# Cyber Log Analysis

A simple cybersecurity practice project for detecting suspicious activity in server logs.  
This project simulates the work of a Security Analyst by parsing access logs, identifying failed login attempts, and flagging potential brute-force attacks.

---

## 📌 Overview
- Reads a sample `access.log` file.
- Detects failed login attempts (`401` status codes).
- Counts attempts per IP address.
- Flags IPs with **3 or more failed logins** as suspicious.
